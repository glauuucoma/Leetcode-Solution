Two Pointers Technique

One slow-runner and the other fast-runner.
A classic example is to remove duplicates from a sorted array, which is available for you to practice here.

There is another variation to that:

One pointer starts from the beginning while the other pointer starts from the end.
They move toward each other until they both meet.
