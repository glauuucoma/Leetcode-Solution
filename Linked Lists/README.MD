# Linked List is a data structure that uses Nodes

# Each node point to previous and contains value

# The head of the Linked List points to head

# The end points at null

Efficiency of Linked List operations:

Singly Linked List / Doubly Linked List

Access element: O(n)/O(n)
Add/Remove at an iterator position: O(1)/O(1)
Add/Remove first element: O(1)/O(1)
Add last element: O(1)/O(1)
Remove Last element: O(n)/O(1)
